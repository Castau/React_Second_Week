## React_Second_Week

This weeks assignments are all placed in this [(React_Second_Week)](https://github.com/Castau/React_Second_Week) repository. To see what belongs to a specific weekday and assignment, see the links below.

### Monday Assignment Exercise
* The **Monday** assignments include these files:  
  * [Demo1 and Demo2 (done in class)](https://github.com/Castau/React_Second_Week/tree/master/Monday_In_Class/src), Thomas told us that was equivalent with Demo1 and Demo2.
  * [React with routing](https://github.com/Castau/React_Second_Week/tree/master/monday_exercise/src)   
    
### Tuesday Assignment Exercise
* The **Tuesday** assignments include these files:  
  * [ReactRouter-Demo](https://github.com/Castau/React_Second_Week/tree/master/tuesday) Thomas told us that this exercise was equivalent with the Demo3 and Demo4.

### Friday Assignment Exercise
* The **Tuesday** assignments include these files:  
  * [ReactRouter-Demo - same as tuesday](https://github.com/Castau/React_Second_Week/tree/master/tuesday) - again we were told to just do either the tuesday or friday exercise as they are equivalent. 


I haven't had as much time as I usually do to complete the exercises this week, so some of them are not done compeltely, and I haven't answered the questions asked in the individual exercises this week.
